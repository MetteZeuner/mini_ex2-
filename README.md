<h3>Coding Process<h3>
<h5>Before I began the actual coding process I really took my time reflecting upon the concept of errors/glitches/noises. I tried remembering examples of errors or glitches i've experienced in other programs and tried figuring out how i could express one of these errors through my program. The error I chose was actually not a concious "error" in the beginning. I was experiementing with different "structures" in my program, not reallly knowing much about what they did, and when I chose the structure "remove" and ran the program I literally thought that an error had happened, because I was surprised that the "remove" structure removed the whole sketch (and not just the cartton which i had expected). After reading about this "remove" structure, i learned and understood why the program reacted the way it did, and thus the error went from an unconscious to a conscious error, and I decided to keep it, because it really think it represents the frustration that an error can cause, when you don't understand what is going on "behind the scenes".<h5>

<h3>What Constitutes an Error?<h3> 
<h5>A program is a piece of software that contains an algorithm which is basically a code with set of instructions that tells the program what, where, when and how to do something. This algorithm follows a syntax which is a set of rules that defines what the correct way to write the symbols and text are in order for the program to read and run the code properly.<h5>

<h3>Reflect on the notion of errors? What is error to you<h3> 
<h5>My initial thought of errors is as a negative thing that leads to frustration. When I think of errors it can either be something that completely limits the user of interacting with the program or it can be something that affects the experience negatively, for example you may be able to use the program but the error makes the interaction difficult or aesthetically unpleasing.<h5>
